This is a proof of concept [Scala Play](https://www.playframework.com/) application running [SparkSQL](http://spark.apache.org/sql/) for making predictions of the next word for an input sentence using a prebuilt simple [N-gram model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model#n-gram_models).
It was used as a server-side part of the [Data Science Specialization Capstone Project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-project).
